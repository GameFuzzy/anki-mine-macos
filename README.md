# Consult 'anki-mine --help' for instructions on how to use the script.

# DEPENDENCIES: # - python 3.9 or higher, sox, ffmpeg, jp-mining-note (you only
need to have the add-on installed; you do not have to use it as your note type).

# - For recording audio you'll need an audio loopback driver such as
https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole. # Instructions on how to set up
BlackHole can be found here:
https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/wiki/Multi-Output-Device.

# You can either configure it to be used as your system-wide default audio
output as is shown in the last step of the linked guide (not recommended) or
configure it to only be the default output for Wine by using 'winecfg' and,
under the Audio submenu, choosing "Multi-Output device" as the default audio
output device.

# Contact me on Discord @gamefuzzy if you need any help with setting it up.

# NOTES: # The script will not work if you change the filename from
"anki-mine.sh" to something else. # # You may need to change some of the
configuration options below:
